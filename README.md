# ZunePlayer

This is a metro styled music played themed on the famous Zune player released by Microsoft. Microsoft had released Zune HD and zune music devices as a competitor to iPods. It wasnt a runway success, but it did win the hearts of thousands with its metro themed UI.

This player, built in Angular, is a tribute to the Metro UI, perfected by Microsoft and loved by many. Zune may be no more, but it will always remains in the hearts of Metro fans.

Note: As it is based on Zune desktop player, this is a dektop webapp and is meant for viewing on desktop screens.
A mobile UI in the works at the moment
